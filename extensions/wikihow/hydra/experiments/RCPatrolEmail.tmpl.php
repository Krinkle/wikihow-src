Hey there!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats! Your first contribution on <?php print("<a href=\"" . $articleURL . "\">" . $articleName . "</a>"); ?> was just approved for publishing by <?php print("<a href=\"" . $userURL . "\">" . $username . "</a>"); ?>. This process of “recent changes patrol” helps us keep good contributions on the site while quickly removing the less helpful ones.  Your contribution was good, and now it’s visible to all our readers!<br/>
<br/>
The fact that you got one of your first contributions successfully patrolled shows that you’re off to a great start around here. Right on!

Hope to see you on the site again soon! I’m not going to send an email every time your contributions get patrolled :) I just wanted to let you know you’re on the right track. If you ever need help with anything, feel free to send me an email or post on my <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/User_Talk:Krystle">talk page</a>.<br/>
